## A decentralized subnet base for Hypertensor.

The Hypertensor Subnet Base includes all the core components required to launch a decentralized AI application, including:
- **[Kademlia DHT (KAD-DHT)][bittorrent]** â€“ for scalable, decentralized storage and routing
- **Asyncio-based DHT Node** â€“ designed for fast, concurrent communications
- **DHT Protocol** â€“ allows DHT nodes to request keys/neighbors from other DHT nodes, and manages routing tables
- **DHT Record Storage** â€“ decentralized key-value storage with support for versioned and validated records with customizable predicate extensions
- **Record Validators** â€“ attach custom validation logic to any stored record, such as key authentication and Pydantic schemas
- **DHT Traversal Tools** â€“ Traverse the DHT graph
- **Routing Tables** â€“ manage network topology and neighbor nodes. A data structure that contains DHT peers bucketed according to their distance to node_id. Follows Kademlia routing table
- **P2P Servicer Base** â€“ register RPC methods to the DHT for nodes to call on one another with security authorizer extensions
- **Proof-of-Stake Integration** â€“ incentivize and secure participation, i.e. must be staked to join the subnet
- **Hypertensor Consensus** â€“ Ready to run in parallel to the Hypertensor consensus mechanism
- **Substrate Integration** â€“ Connect to Hypertensor with an RPC endpoint
- **Secure Communication** â€“ support for Ed25519 and RSA authentication for communication

> ðŸ’¡ **Focus on Logic, Not Plumbing**
> The networking, cryptography, consensus, and storage layers are already handled. As a subnet builder, your only responsibility is to implement the application logic â€” the custom AI protocols and behaviors that live on top of the DHT.

## Installation From source

### From source

To install this container from source, simply run the following:

```
git clone https://github.com/hypertensor-blockchain/mesh.git
cd mesh
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install .
```

If you would like to verify that your installation is working properly, you can install with `pip install .[dev]`
instead. Then, you can run the tests with `pytest tests/`.

By default, the contatiner uses the precompiled binary of
the [go-libp2p-daemon](https://github.com/hypertensor-blockchain/go-libp2p-daemon) library. If you face compatibility issues or want to build the binary yourself, you can recompile it by running `pip install . --global-option="--buildgo"`.

Before running the compilation, please ensure that your machine has a recent version
of [Go toolchain](https://golang.org/doc/install) (1.15 or 1.16 are supported).

### System requirements

- __Linux__ is the default OS for which the container is developed and tested. We recommend Ubuntu 18.04+ (64-bit), but
  other 64-bit distros should work as well. Legacy 32-bit is not recommended.
- __macOS__ is partially supported.
  If you have issues, you can run the container using [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/mac/install/) instead.
  We recommend using [our Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/hypertensor-blockchain/mesh).
- __Windows 10+ (experimental)__ can run the container
  using [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/ru-ru/windows/wsl/install-win10). You can configure WSL to use GPU by
  following sections 1â€“3 of [this guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/wsl-user-guide/index.html) by NVIDIA. After
  that, you can simply follow the instructions above to install with pip or from source.

# Subnet Documentation

##### Generate coldkey (if needed)

##### Generate hotkey
- This is the hotkey of the node. It is used for validating and attesting only. Each hotkey is unique to each subnet node and no hotkey can be used twice.

##### Generate peer private keys

  - This will create 3 private key files for your peer
      - `peer_id`: Main peer ID for communication and signing
      - `bootstrap_peer_id`: (Optional usage) Peer ID to be used as a bootstrap node.
      - `client_peer_id`: (Optional usage) Peer ID to be used as a client. This is for those who want to build frontends to interact with the subnet.

##### Register & Stake on Hypertensor
  - Call `register_subnet_node`
  - Retrieve your `start_epoch` by querying your SubnetNodesData storage element on polkadot.js with your subnet node ID. This is the epoch you must activate your node on + the grace period

##### Run subnet node
<i>(fill in docs here, examples are alow below)</i>

##### Activate node
  - Call `activate_subnet_node` in Hypertensor on your start epoch up to the grace period.

---
## Running Nodes
Fill in the following with your subnets documentation on how to join the subnet, requirements, etc.

### Run bootnode 
A bootnode is an entry point into a decentralized network. 

Each subnet must have at least one public and running bootnode at all times available for Overwatch Nodes to validate a subnet is running.

- Replace port 31330 with your port of choice.
- Replace `{your_ip}` with your IP.

##### Start Bootnode and Start Subnet
###### This starts an entirely new subnet and runs a bootnode
```bash
mesh-dht \
--host_maddrs /ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/31330 /ip4/0.0.0.0/udp/31330/quic \
--announce_maddrs /ip4/{your_ip}/tcp/31330 /ip4/{your_ip}/udp/31330/quic \
--identity_path server2.id
```

##### Start Bootnode and Join Subnet
###### This joins an existing subnets and runs a bootnode.
- Get the bootnode multiaddresses from the subnets team or blockchain and add them to the `initial_peers` argument.
```bash
mesh-dht \
--host_maddrs /ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/31330 /ip4/0.0.0.0/udp/31330/quic \
--announce_maddrs /ip4/{your_ip} \
--initial_peers /ip4/{ip}/p2p/{peer_id} /ip4/{ip}/p2p/{peer_id}
```

### Run node 
*Fill in how to start and run a node for your subnet!*

##### Start DHT / Start Node
NOT SUGGESTED
This will start a new subnet (fresh swarm as initial node)
```bash
mesh-server-mock \
--host_maddrs /ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/31330 /ip4/0.0.0.0/udp/31330/quic \
--announce_maddrs /ip4/{your_ip}/tcp/31330 /ip4/{your_ip}/udp/31330/quic \
--identity_path server2.id \
--new_swarm  \
--subnet_id 1 --subnet_node_id 1
```

##### Join DHT / Start Node
```bash
mesh-server-mock \
--host_maddrs /ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/31330 /ip4/0.0.0.0/udp/31330/quic \
--announce_maddrs /ip4/{your_ip}/tcp/31330 /ip4/{your_ip}/udp/31330/quic \
--identity_path server2.id \
--subnet_id 1 --subnet_node_id 1
```

## Future

- Migrate to py-libp2p (from go-libp2p-daemon).
- Random-walk
- Gossip protocol integration
- Noise Protocol (Diffie-Hellman key exchange)
- Onion routing or mixnet options
- Multiple encryption options
- Explore alternative tensor/AI parameter compression options
- DHT Record uniqueness options
- Runtime upgrades
- In-subnet epochs (synced to blockchain clock), plus ledger integration
- Etc.
